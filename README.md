## Ama-Food-Delivery

A distributed message-based food ordering system developed with RabbitMQ, SpringBoot, Spring AOP, Spring Data Jpa and PostGreSQL.It allows clients to place orders and track them. It consists of three integral components - order-service, restaurant-service and email-service. The order-service exposes REST endpoints that allow clients to fetch the food menu, place an order and track the order in real-time. Once the client places an order, the order-service persists the order details on a MongoDB server, publishes it to a RabbitMQ Exchange and returns a confirmation response which includes the order ID to track the order. The Exchange is configured with a fanout pattern which publishes the order to the two queues that have been bound to it - order.process and order.confirmation. While placing it on the queue, the 'status' field of the order holds the value 'pending'. A restaurant-service consumes the order from the order.process queue and an email-service consumes the order from the order.confirmation queue. Once the restaurant-service consumes the order, it modifies the 'state' of the order to 'accepted' in the database. The email-service on the other hand sends an order confirmation to the email address specified in the order. After a pre-defined time period, the restaurant-service modifies the 'state' to 'delivered' in the database indicating that the order has been delivered.
